## NFC demo from [Seeed Studio][1]
We are always exploring to new ways to connect with things easily.
Here we bring NFC technology to you. Now we can exchange data between android and Arduino + [NFC Shield][2] with a simple touch.
You may be curious of how NFC technology can be used. There are two demos to inspire you.
### Black Box

![Schrodinger's cat][3]

We can't not tell the cat in Schrodinger's black box alive or dead. Fortunately, when we get a black box in real life,
we can use some technology to get thorough understanding of the black box. Here we use NFC technology and some sensors
to equip a black box with a cat. Just use a NFC enabled Android to touch the black box, and a specific app will 
be launched **automatically** and display the conditions of the back box.

### Tsukkomi Paper Man

![printer][5]

Use your android to touch the header of Paper Man, and send something to Paper Man. The Paper Man will print it out


### How to
Curious of how these demos work? Have a look at the code.

To get started, download the [NFC library][6] for Arduino and follow the examples in the library.
